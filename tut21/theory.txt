CSS SPECIFICITY:
    CSS Specificity helps determine what style will be applied to the HTML element(s) when there are overlapping or multiple CSS rules.

The Cascade Algorithm:
    CSS stands for Cascading Stylesheets. The cascade is the algorithm for solving conflicts where multiple CSS rules apply to an HTML element.

The cascade algorithm has 4 distinct stages.

    (i)Position and order of appearance: the order in which your CSS rules appear
    (ii)Specificity: an algorithm that determines which CSS selector has the strongest match
    (iii)Origin: the order in which CSS appears and where it comes from, whether that is a browser style, CSS from a browser extension, or your authored CSS
    (iv)Importance: some CSS rules are weighted more heavily than others, especially with the !important rule type

      
The order of specificity is:
    Inline Style > ID Selector > Class or Attribute Selector > Element Selector > Universal Selector

Specificity Calculation:

  To calculate specificity, assign a value to each part of the selector:
    Universal Selector: 0 
    Element selectors and pseudo-elements: 1 
    Class selectors, attribute selectors, and pseudo-classes: 10 
    ID selectors: 100  
    Inline styles: 1000 
    Then, add up the values of all the parts in the selector.

  Here is an example 
    /*
    <h1 id="title" class="h1">CodeWithHarry</h1>
    */
  Here, the specificity value will be 111 because ID has a specificity of 100, the class has a specificity of 10, and the h1 element has a specificity of 1.

Importance:
  The !important flag in CSS is used to give a particular style rule the highest level of importance, overriding any other competing styles. When you add !important to a CSS rule, it will take precedence over other rules affecting the same element, regardless of their specificity. 

  Here is an example-

      /* 
      p {
        color: red !important;
      }
      p {
        color: blue;
      }
      */
  
  An !important at the end of a CSS value gets a specificity score of 10,000 points. This is the highest specificity that one individual item can get. However, it's generally best to use !important sparingly, as it can make debugging and maintaining your stylesheets more complicated. It can override styles in ways that are hard to trace, leading to unexpected results.

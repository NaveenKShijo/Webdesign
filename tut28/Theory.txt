    The default position property is static. At this stage, top, left & z-index features cannot be implemented. To implement them, "position:relative" is chosen

    top: This feature enables us to move the element in vertical direction.
    left: It allows us to shift the element in horizontal direction.
    z-index: When two elements are stacked upon one another, the color of the element with higher z-index will be displayed.

Position properties:
    (i)static (default)
    (ii)relative
    (iii)absolute: 
            In this case, the div will be in position relative to the nearest positioned element (ie., position except static).
    (iv)fixed:
            As ads are fixed at certain locations of a website as we scroll through the website. This is achieved through fixed position.
                It will only work when there is top or left.
    (v)sticky:
            This property allows us to keep certain elements at top, as we scroll through website,as freezing rows in Excel.
                It will only work when there is top or left.
            It is used to implement nav bars.
